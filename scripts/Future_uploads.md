# Future Uploads 

Most of the basic scripts to analyse the data have already been written. However, due to time limitations, they're still not optimised for sharing. Currently working on this, functions that will be added:

- Corrected background subtraction
- Anisotropy analysis
- Coupling to rheology data
- Multiscale peak detection

In the long term, a planned addition is to develop a GUI to perform the analysis, which integrates all the above and allows for easier user interaction and real-time processing.
